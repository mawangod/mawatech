An exam, an important interview, a bad patch… We all face stress once in our life. Ball in the stomach, sweaty hands, insomnia… It is sometimes very difficult to manage. To fight against it, there are remedies, but it also involves food: what should you eat to reduce stress?

"Products that give energy, you need color on the plate, a variety of foods, to have the necessary vitamin intake to overcome this difficult period," says Dr. Nina Cohen-Koubi, nutritionist. She advises to eat fruits, vegetables, in particular peppers, champion of the vitamin C content.

"You also need a good intake of omega-3", which is found in oily fish such as tuna or salmon, or even avocado. These healthy fats reduce stress and anxiety, according to several studies, including that of a team of Japanese researchers. Their work has been published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).

Specialists also advise drinking enough, consuming brown rice, quinoa, but also potatoes, nuts, seeds ... These foods help produce serotonin, the hormone of happiness. A tip? We take the time to chew, and we do not eat in front of our screen: meals are special moments to think about yourself!

Actions to avoid
"People who have a stroke of blues, or who stress, tend to want to have fun, by eating sugar, for example," explains nutristionist Nina Cohen-Koubi. Error: sugar has an action on the brain, it raises dopamine, a neurotransmitter that provides pleasure. But "stimulated too often, it also causes irritation, impaired concentration, and memory impairment." What worsen his stress.

In addition, it is better not to eat fatty foods or drink alcohol, to avoid weight gain. "When you have a rise in pressure, cortisol is stimulated, the stress hormone", informs the specialist. Result? "The insulin levels increase and the fat-burning hormone leptin is inhibited. The individual will be hungry, will tend to be more tired and to store up." Stress therefore tends to promote weight gain.

Doctor Nina Cohen-Koubi lists other tips to reduce stress: she strongly recommends taking the time for yourself, doing some relaxation exercises that involve breathing, meditation, listening to music, taking a bath, or quite simply to close your eyes while you clear your mind.
