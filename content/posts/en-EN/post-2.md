<h2> 1. Have effective communication </h2>

Communication is the first asset to become exceptional at work.
It is a fundamental part of how you will achieve your goals each day. You just can't be exceptional until you are a great communicator.

Great communicators inspire people. They create a connection with others that is real, emotional and personal, regardless of the physical distance between them.

Great communicators forge this connection through an understanding of people and an ability to respond directly to their needs.

<h2> 2. Have courage </h2>

People need courage, but that's easier said than done, we grant you.

For the brave, adversity is a welcome test. Like the casting of a blacksmith on a hot iron, adversity is a test by fire that will sharpen your game.
Adversity emboldens you, but never forget to listen to others!

<h2> 3. Know yourself </h2>

Self-awareness is the foundation of emotional intelligence.

Strong self-awareness means having a clear and precise picture not only of how you work, but also of your own strengths and weaknesses.

You need to know where you shine and where you will be weak, in order to build on your strengths and compensate for your weaknesses.

<h2> 4. Be passionate </h2>

Passion and enthusiasm are contagious. Boredom and apathy are too.

Be passionate about what you do and strive to share that passion with everyone around you.

<h2> 5. Be generous! </h2>

Share your credit and offer enthusiastic praise. Be as committed to the success of your colleagues as you are to yours. Inspire others to reach their personal best - not only because it will make your team perform better, but because you will care about each person as an individual.

<h2> 6. Be authentic </h2>

Authenticity refers to being honest in all things - not just what you say and do, but who you are. When you are genuine, your words and actions are who you say you are.

Your coworkers shouldn't have to spend time trying to figure out if you have ulterior motives. The time they spend doing it erodes their confidence in you and their ability to perform.

<h2> 7. Feeling responsible </h2>

Don't take the blame and avoid shame when you fail.

Making mistakes happens to everyone!

<h3> Put it all together </h3>

Becoming exceptional at work doesn't mean you have to incorporate all of these traits at once. Focus on one or two at a time; every gradual improvement will make you more exceptional every day. The more you practice these habits, the more instinctive it will become.
