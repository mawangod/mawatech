<h2> Playing with light and shadows </h2>

Very important for taking beautiful photos: light! At sunrise or sunset the colors are wonderfully beautiful, different depending on the time of day, blue in the morning and golden in the evening. During the day, you should absolutely avoid taking photos between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. because shadows are almost nonexistent, although they are necessary to mark the depth of an image. The worst thing is to take pictures with the sun from the front because they will be overexposed with a light without shadows (necessary to mark the depth of the photo). The best way to make great photos is to have the sun behind your back or a setting sun facing downwards which allows you to play with light and shadow, for example with people or objects in front of a sunset. Your photos will have an extraordinary rendering.

<h2> Stand out by working on originality </h2>

For photography to become an art, it is above all necessary to find inspiration. The first thing to do is to ask yourself questions about what we want to convey in our image: a size or the immensity of a site, the color of a tree or a costume, the movement of a dance, emotion on a face, sadness or happiness? On the other hand, we have to shake up our habits and work on shooting and perspective, avoiding the one-on-one that everyone does. A side or angle shot, with a visual in the foreground (branch in shadow, colored flowers, statue or part of an object, a silhouette or a shadow, a hand or an object, a window or an opening , etc.). You can also work on reflections and shadows in the water, in puddles, or even use the landscapes with a part of you (the sun setting between your fingers, a steeple as a hat, etc.). Because to photograph is also and above all to let go of your creativity!

<h2> Daring unusual framing </h2>

We all tend to frame our subjects in the center of the shot, but that's a mistake! On the contrary, you should not center your subject but place it either a little to the right or a little to the left. Or, try more ambitious framing like positioning a horizon at the bottom of the image rather than in the middle. Original framing will give your photo all the interest! On the other hand, the rule of thirds is also fundamental to give depth to your shots. It is she who will determine the balance in the composition of the image. The rule of thirds - also found on some cameras - draws two vertical lines and two horizontal lines at equal distances, to form nine rectangles on the lens. You must then position the future elements of your photo along the lines or at one of the points of intersection of the lines.

<h2> Don't forget the small adjustments </h2>

And finally, of course, we don't forget the small adjustments! Although on a smartphone the focus is done automatically, you can target the part of the image you want to highlight or darken by clicking with your finger at the appropriate place on the screen. Plus, even though everyone knows, a blurry photo is a failed photo. To stay still, take a mini tripod!
